# EntitySearch - Current version 1.0.0
Lightweight library that extends the IQueryable<T> interface to create queries searching through every entity property

OBS: The idea behind this library is to execute queries on EF Entities breaking the text quered in tokens and comparing if anyone of the properties of that entity has this or more tokens.

*All functionality in EntitySearch has been migrated to ModelWrapper, which will later be called EntityWrapper.*
